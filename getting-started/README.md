# Getting Started

This folder contains simple examples to show the concepts of Lepton photons. Please refer to the subdirectories for more detailed instruction for how to run them - the source code usually contains self-explanatory comments.

## Example list
- counter: simple demonstrative photons to implement a counter, and a safe counter using file as state storage. More related reads: [Anatomy of a photon](https://www.lepton.ai/docs/walkthrough/anatomy_of_a_photon), [Storage](https://www.lepton.ai/docs/advanced/storage)
- extra_files: an example to show how one can include additional files to the photon.
- shell: a photon that runs a simple shell, and returns stdout and stderr.
- custom-image: an example that uses custom Docker image in your Photon.
